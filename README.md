# MR Interview - Refactor Challenge

## Intro

Welcome to MR Refactor Challenge.

The goal of this challenge is to improve the quality of the code and ensure that the app works without any errors.

### What you should do?

- Improve general code structure & readability
- Utilize TypeScript better
- Slightly improve the UI
- Extract some functions or components if needed
- Add extra functionality if you're feeling up to it -- can use mock data, interact with the blockchain, or just make a cool design -- anything you'd like. 

### What not to do?

Do not:

- Rebuild completely the design
- Modify the data returned by API
- Remove Next.js or replace it with different React framework
- Remove Tailwind or replace it with different CSS framework

Files you can ignore, that don't need / require any changes:

- ./vscode/extensions.json
- .eslintrc.json
- .gitignore
- .prettierrc
- next-env.d.ts
- next.config.js
- postcss.config.js
- README.md
- tailwind.config.js
- tsconfig.json
- public/

## Technologies used

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Headless UI](https://headlessui.dev/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

#### Hints

- Don't forget to check `package.json`
- HTML code probably may be better?
- CSS modules are nice, but do they help here?
